pin-hybrid-cache-sim
====================

a Pin based fast hybrid scratchpad memory/ cache functional simulator

pin hybrid cache sim(aka phcs) extends and modifies *Memory* tool from pintool distribution which is originally written by Artur Klauser and extended by Rodric Rabbah (rodric@gmail.com) . It was originally an ISA-portable cache simulator.

I modify this tool, add scratchpad memory simulation module to make it a hybrid cache simulator. Hope it is usefully for someone else :-)
